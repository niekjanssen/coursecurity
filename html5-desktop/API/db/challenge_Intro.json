Below we've explained only a few of them.</p> <h5>Brute Force attack</h5><ul> <li style=\" font-size: 13px;\">Brute force attacks is when an attacker try to force there way through, by trying every single combination of passwords.</li> <li style=\" font-size: 13px;\">A computer is incredible fast a can try a lot of combination very quick. It would for example take seconds to try every combination for a 4 digit pin.</li> <li style=\" font-size: 13px;\">A Brute force attack is good against weaker passwords shorter passwords, but when the passwords is over 8 characters it starts to take to long. </li></ul><h5>Dictionary attack</h5> <ul><li style=\" font-size: 13px;\">A Dictionary attack is when an attacker try to force there way through, by using a predefined list with combination as potential passwords. The list could be a dictionary with words, a list made out of combination, etc. </li> <li style=\" font-size: 13px;\">Using a dictionary attack an attacker can breach passwords based on longer words which would take to long, when doing a bruteforce. </li> <li style=\" font-size: 13px;\"> A dictionary attack is good against users that are using patterns for creating there passwords. However, struggles against random combinations.</li></ul><h5>Password stuffing</h5><ul><li style=\" font-size: 13px;\">Stuffing is when an attacker uses information found else where, e.g. usernames and passwords, and try to stuff it into a different system.</li><li style=\" font-size: 13px;\">Password stuffing is good when users uses the same password across different platform, since a weakness is one platform results in a weakness in other. </li> </ul>",
